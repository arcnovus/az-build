# Idiomatic Best Practices Preference

When implementing solutions or making technical decisions:

## General Principle

**ALWAYS** prefer idiomatic, well-established best practices over exotic, custom, or overly tailored solutions.

- Choose solutions that are widely recognized and documented in the community
- Prefer standard library features and well-maintained, popular libraries over custom implementations
- Use patterns and approaches that other developers will recognize and understand
- Avoid reinventing the wheel or creating unnecessary abstractions

## Verification and Research

**ALWAYS** verify best practices by consulting current documentation and authoritative sources.

When implementing a solution or choosing an approach:

1. **Search for current best practices** using web search before implementing
2. **Prefer documentation written in the last 12-18 months** when available
3. **Consult official documentation** from framework/library maintainers first
4. **Check community consensus** through Stack Overflow, GitHub discussions, or official forums
5. **Verify patterns** are still current and not deprecated

## When to Use Web Search

Use web search to confirm best practices when:

- Implementing a new feature or pattern you haven't used recently
- Choosing between multiple approaches to solve a problem
- Using a framework, library, or language feature for the first time
- Encountering conflicting advice or outdated patterns
- Deciding between standard library vs. third-party solutions
- Evaluating architectural patterns or design decisions

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

- Creating custom implementations when standard solutions exist
- Using deprecated or outdated patterns without checking for modern alternatives
- Implementing complex workarounds instead of using built-in features
- Choosing exotic libraries over well-established, maintained alternatives
- Making decisions based solely on personal preference without verifying current best practices
- Ignoring official documentation in favor of blog posts or tutorials without checking recency

## Examples

| Bad (Exotic/Custom) | Good (Idiomatic) | Why |
|---------------------|------------------|-----|
| Custom state management solution | Use TanStack Query or server-side state management | Well-tested, documented, maintainable, reduces client-side state complexity |
| Custom authentication implementation | Use established auth library/framework with security-first design | Security best practices, maintained, reduces attack surface |
| Manual dependency injection container | Use framework's built-in DI or established library | Standard pattern, well-documented |
| Custom HTTP client wrapper | Use standard library `fetch` or established HTTP client | Idiomatic, widely understood |
| Custom date/time manipulation | Use established library (date-fns, moment, etc.) | Handles edge cases, timezone issues |
| Reinventing common algorithms | Use standard library or well-tested library | Proven, optimized |
| Custom build tooling | Use established build tools (webpack, vite, etc.) | Community support, documentation |

## Best Practices

1. **Research First**: Before implementing, search for current best practices and verify with recent documentation
2. **Official Sources**: Prioritize official documentation from maintainers over third-party tutorials
3. **Recency Matters**: Prefer documentation and examples from the last 12-18 months when available
4. **Community Consensus**: When multiple approaches exist, choose the one with broader community adoption
5. **Standard Library First**: Prefer standard library features over third-party solutions when functionality is equivalent
6. **Maintainability**: Choose solutions that future developers (including yourself) will understand and maintain easily
7. **Documentation Quality**: Prefer solutions with good, current documentation over those with outdated or sparse docs
